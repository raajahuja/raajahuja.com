                    I originally wrote this is on Instagram. My thought process on this post was w.r.to hiring people, 
                    Creating Self-Organized and Process-Organized Teams and the way perspective, vision and the  way we 
                    imagine the world that we want to live in or create for others to live in and then a new perspective comes which 
                    either acknowledges the actions made by previous regime, take over the charge, either play blame-game or work towards 
                    that and makes a new regime that either sets an example or gives food for thought. Because thoughts, words & speeches matter 
                    to certain extent but what matters is the actions and accomplishments we had after that. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Here is the Piece:</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We do something what we like, and we try to create our own world and try to include those people into our world with whom it resonates. Now you have Layer 1. These Layer1 bring other people with whom they resonate, and it becomes Layer2 and cycle goes on. And at Layer n there are people who’s some of values are resonating with Layer n-1 such as need of money, need of job, need to work on certain stuff etc. When such values resonate you do something together at value level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And sometimes we are part of the world in which we don't like the things the way there are. We don't like the people who do certain stuff. We don't like that they don't think beyond what is there. We don't like that they don't think. And we don't like the vibe.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We feel trapped. To come out of that we try to create own world where we find people whose values are resonated and are challenged by certain thoughts and actions.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    And with such kind of system. Some people will be unhappy. Some people will not be satisfied.
                    And with strong belief & conviction such unhappy people try to create the own world where they find people with whom it resonates and out of that process again some unhappy people are produced, and cycle goes on
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In such process the one who stands for himself. And stands for the people, sustain for a certain period until and unless the challenged one comes again which repeats the process.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Is it resonating ?

                <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
                    I always wanted to build something and release it for usage especially in the context of Software.
                    I firmly believe in this line - "Converting your idea or thoughts into something tangible that other humans can interact with and in turn use it daily to have an impact in their life is a wonderful process in itself". I love it and I love to follow it again and again. It makes me high.<br />
                    <br />
                    Although my many attempts to convert an idea into some sort of tangible thing have not been fruitful. Starting with my first project on HR Chatbot to Zypnos to MLTag. Although when I look back all were valid problems to tackle but somehow failed to achieve an inflection point in a fast way and getting the product into the hands of the user and getting immediate feedback was not achieved.<br />
                    <br />
                    Recently I along with the help of Madhu, who is my architect in the team we built Anvesha which is a simple Keyword Searching in the code and I released the Java JAR to my team. I was happy that it will be used by 13 people whenever they will write a process bot to check unwanted keywords in the code. But still it was for internal use.<br />
                    <br />
                    But today for the first time in my 3.5 years of SAP Career I released something to a customer, something tangible. In my current role where I develop Process bots for S/4HANA Business Processes, I released 2 bots to customers on bot store which were Create Sales Inquiry and Process Order Confirmation.
                    Information such as how customers are using a bot or impact such information is kept up in the organization hierarchy and it takes time to get that but while clicking on the release button, I got a great feeling of pride and i was happy.<br />
                    <br />
                    Check out the bots here:<br />

                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">I wrote this piece in 2016 when I was presenting the idea in a Startup Hackathon at SAP with my team. The idea was around a simple HR Chatbot and the chatbot industry was itself in a very immature and nascent stage in 2016 and no one from the team has ever built or understand how to build a chatbot. Yet the way we worked as a team and the way we took responsibility and ownership was amazing. From creating an Android App to Training the Model to Focusing on Design Aspect and Preparation for presentation. It created a sense of completeness and belonging. We ended up being a Finalist and worked further together for a very long time on different ideas and formed different tribes on our own and from that, I wrote a little piece that I experienced at that moment.</span><br />

                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Sometimes you get a group of people With Whom Your Bonding is strong.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">It becomes stronger and stronger day by day.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We all fight.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Criticize.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We appreciate.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Solve Problems.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Create Things.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Do Good for People.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Make Each Other better version of ourselves</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">At last, we become an average of people around us &amp; this becomes our world. But the real world is much larger than this world &amp; It’s our job to form small worlds in which we meet great people and form tribes. During this process don’t even try to compromise your self-integrity. You don’t need to suppress your personality as you grow up, You will find your tribe that will match your highness.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">I have made this as one of my mantras wherever you are: "Find your tribe", it helps.</span></div>
