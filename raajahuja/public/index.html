                <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
                    I always wanted to build something and release it for usage especially in the context of Software.
                    I firmly believe in this line - "Converting your idea or thoughts into something tangible that other humans can interact with and in turn use it daily to have an impact in their life is a wonderful process in itself". I love it and I love to follow it again and again. It makes me high.<br />
                    <br />
                    Although my many attempts to convert an idea into some sort of tangible thing have not been fruitful. Starting with my first project on HR Chatbot to Zypnos to MLTag. Although when I look back all were valid problems to tackle but somehow failed to achieve an inflection point in a fast way and getting the product into the hands of the user and getting immediate feedback was not achieved.<br />
                    <br />
                    Recently I along with the help of Madhu, who is my architect in the team we built Anvesha which is a simple Keyword Searching in the code and I released the Java JAR to my team. I was happy that it will be used by 13 people whenever they will write a process bot to check unwanted keywords in the code. But still it was for internal use.<br />
                    <br />
                    But today for the first time in my 3.5 years of SAP Career I released something to a customer, something tangible. In my current role where I develop Process bots for S/4HANA Business Processes, I released 2 bots to customers on bot store which were Create Sales Inquiry and Process Order Confirmation.
                    Information such as how customers are using a bot or impact such information is kept up in the organization hierarchy and it takes time to get that but while clicking on the release button, I got a great feeling of pride and i was happy.<br />
                    <br />
                    Check out the bots here:<br />

            <h2>Find Your Tribe</h2>
            <span style="font-family :'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif">January 17, 2020</span>

                <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
                <div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">
                <div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: inherit; margin-bottom: 1.75em;">

                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">I wrote this piece in 2016 when I was presenting the idea in a Startup Hackathon at SAP with my team. The idea was around a simple HR Chatbot and the chatbot industry was itself in a very immature and nascent stage in 2016 and no one from the team has ever built or understand how to build a chatbot. Yet the way we worked as a team and the way we took responsibility and ownership was amazing. From creating an Android App to Training the Model to Focusing on Design Aspect and Preparation for presentation. It created a sense of completeness and belonging. We ended up being a Finalist and worked further together for a very long time on different ideas and formed different tribes on our own and from that, I wrote a little piece that I experienced at that moment.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><b><u>Here is the piece :</u></b></span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Sometimes you get a group of people With Whom Your Bonding is strong.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">It becomes stronger and stronger day by day.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We all fight.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Criticize.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We appreciate.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Solve Problems.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Create Things.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Do Good for People.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">We Make Each Other better version of ourselves</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">At last, we become an average of people around us &amp; this becomes our world. But the real world is much larger than this world &amp; It’s our job to form small worlds in which we meet great people and form tribes. During this process don’t even try to compromise your self-integrity. You don’t need to suppress your personality as you grow up, You will find your tribe that will match your highness.</span><br />
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span>
                    <span style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">I have made this as one of my mantras wherever you are: "Find your tribe", it helps.</span></div>
